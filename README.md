## Update procedures:

- Test development files will have `_proto#` appended to the end of the file name
- Changes will be committed by selecting `create a new branch` and then performing a `pull request` to merge the updated content
- Updates should be named or have comments identifying what has been updated or changed
- Any repository path structure changes should be communicated to all indivduals who directly update the repository
- There should be no relative links on any pages so all links should be made absolute
- Create all files in locations that reflects where they will be eventually published when created on Canada.ca
- In the [_config.yml](https://github.com/cra-design/gst-hst-business/blob/main/_config.yml) file the `developerOptions:` setting should be changed to `false` before testing takes place

## Custom page template options

- The `Edit button` on the banner toggles **contenteditable** on and off allowing editing of the live page **Note:** Any changes made are not saved and will be lost if navigated off the page or the browser tab is closed or refreshed
- The `Github button` on the banner will take you to the the source page on github  
- All pages links and forms that direct outside of the repository to will automatically be replaced with links to the **exit intent page**
  - The data attribute `data-exit="false"` can be used on `<a>` and `<form>` tags directed outside of the github domain so that replacement links are not generated to direct them automatically through the **exit intent page**
- The option `sourceurl` in the **YAML** section of the page code allows you to add URLs (settings the **link** and **title**) that will appear in the banner for easy navigation to pages you deem relevant to add
- Additional custom `layout` options that are available in the **YAML** section of the page code are:
  - `no-test-banner` - removes the top banner from the page
  - `without-h1-test-banner` - removes the top banner and the h1 for the page is not automatically generated

Additional site wide setting information can be found in the [Support information](https://github.com/cra-design/gst-hst-business/blob/main/docs/SUPPORT.md) readme file
