<!--<h2>What's changed</h2>
    <p>
      <mark>(is this still new? Is the first one specific to IFT or is more general?)</mark>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Under the new GST/HST measures for supplies of cross-border digital products and services, as well as platform-based short-term accommodation, non-resident suppliers, including digital platform operators, may be required to register under a simplified GST/HST framework and collect the GST/HST in respect of those supplies. If you are purchasing products or services from suppliers registered under the simplified GST/HST framework, and you are registered under the normal GST/HST rules, you must provide proof of registration to these suppliers to ensure they do not charge GST/HST on such supplies. Failing to provide this information may result in difficulties in recovering the GST/HST you paid on those supplies since the GST/HST paid cannot be claimed as an input tax credit or a rebate. For more detailed information on recovering the GST/HST paid on supplies acquired from suppliers registered under the simplified registration regime, please consult <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/notice322/recovery-gst-hst-under-digital-economy-measures.html">GST/HST Notice 322</a>.</li>
