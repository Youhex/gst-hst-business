                <p>Usually, you must keep your records for six years from the end of the year to which they relate. This includes all sales and purchase invoices, and all other records related to your business operations and the GST/HST. However, the CRA may ask you to keep the invoices longer than six years. If you want to destroy your records earlier, you have to send the CRA a written request and wait for the written approval.</p>

                <p>As a registrant, you also need the correct information on the invoices you <strong>get</strong> from your suppliers to support your ITC claims.</p>
