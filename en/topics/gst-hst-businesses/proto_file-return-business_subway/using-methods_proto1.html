    <h3>Browser requirements </h3>
<p>There are certain minimum security standards your browser must meet for you to be able to use CRA online filing methods.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-electronic-filing-services-your-browser.html">Confirm your browser settings meet the requirements</a></p>p>
      <!--
    <p>
      <mark>Duplicated - on the DS Your browser page. Links on flat pages point out to the page.</mark>
    </p>
    <p>To make sure you can file your return securely and confidentially, you must use a Web browser that supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. If you don't have a browser that meets the security standard, you can either download a complete browser package or upgrade the one you have. <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">Upgrade to TLS 1.2</a> so that your system is as secure as possible.</p>
    <p>If your browser does not meet the requirements listed above, you may not be able to use GST/HST NETFILE or GST/HST Internet File Transfer.</p>
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency is not responsible for any difficulties or problems in downloading and installing software. Technical support is provided by the software suppliers.</p>
    <h3>Browser settings</h3>
    <p>You must ensure that cookies and JavaScript are enabled in your browser settings.</p>
    <p>Since not all browsers are configured in the same manner, you should check the Internet options of your browser for ways to enable the cookies and JavaScript functions.</p>-->
