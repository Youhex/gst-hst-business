    <h2>When to file GST/HST returns</h2>
    <p>The personalized GST/HST return (Form GST34-2) will show the due date at the top of the form. The due date of your return is determined by your reporting period. We can charge <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-penalties-interest.html">penalties and interest</a> on any returns or amounts we have not received by the due date. If you are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/account-close.html">closing a GST/HST account</a>, you need to file a final return.</p>
    <p>You <strong>have to file</strong> a GST/HST return even if you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>no business transactions</li>
      <li>no net tax to remit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a due date falls on a <strong>Saturday</strong>, a <strong>Sunday</strong>, or a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday recognized by the CRA</a>, your payment is on time if we receive it on the <strong>next business day</strong>.</p>
    <h2>GST/HST filing and payment deadlines</h2>
    <p>The filing deadline will be different depending on your GST/HST filing period.</p>
    <p>To determine the deadline that applies to you, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/pay-when.html">When to pay</a>.</p>
