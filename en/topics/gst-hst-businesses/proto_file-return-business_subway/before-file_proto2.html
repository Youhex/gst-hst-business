    </ul>
    <h2 id="toc2">Filing and payment deadlines</h2>
    <p>The due date of your return is determined by your reporting period. </p>

   <p>If your due date is a <strong>Saturday</strong>, <strong>Sunday</strong> or <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday</a> recognized by the CRA, your return or payment is on time if we receive it on the <strong>next business day</strong>.</p>

                        </details>
<h3>Annual reporting periods</h3>

    <p>There are three situations that determine your filing and final balance payment deadlines as an annual GST/HST filer.</p>
    <h4>Situation 1: fiscal year-end December 31 and taxable income</h4>
<p>If your fiscal year-end is December 31 <strong>and</strong> you have taxable business income for the year:</p>
    <ul>
                           <li>Your <strong>payment</strong> deadline is <strong>April 30</strong></li>
                            <li>Your <strong>filing</strong> deadline is <strong>June 15</strong></li>
</ul>
    <h4>Situation 2: either fiscal year-end other than December 31 or no taxable income</h4>
 <p>If <strong>either</strong> your fiscal year-end is <strong>not</strong> December 31 <strong>or</strong> you have <strong>no</strong> taxable business income for the year:</p>   
    <ul>
                           <li> Your filing and final payment deadline is <strong>3 months after fiscal year-end</strong></li>
</ul>
    <details><summary>Example dates</summary>
    <p>If the fiscal year-end is <strong>August 31</strong>, the payment and filing deadline would be <strong>November 30</strong>.</p>
</details>

    <h4>Situation 3: Listed financial institutions</h4>
<p>If you are a listed financial institution, <strong>except</strong> if you are only a listed financial institutions only because you have a section 150 election in effect:</p>
    <ul>
                           <li> Your filing and final payment deadline is <strong>6 months after fiscal year-end</strong></li>
</ul>    
<p>If you are a listed financial institution only because you have a section 150 election in effect, the deadlines in either situation 1 or 2 apply to you.</p>
<details><summary>Example dates for listed financial institutions</summary>
        <p>If a listed financial institution's fiscal year-end is <strong>October 31</strong>, the payment and filing deadline would be <strong>April 30</strong>, as long as they are not only a listed financial institution because they have a section 150 election in effect.</p>
