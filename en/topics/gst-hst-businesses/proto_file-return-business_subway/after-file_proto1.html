<p>Intro here</p>
<h2>View a previously filed GST/HST return</h2>
<p>You may view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>. You will also be able to view upcoming and overdue GST/HST returns by using the same digital service.</p>
<h2>Changing a return already filed</h2>
<p>Returns can only be adjusted electronically using the My Business Account (MyBA) portal. If you do not already have a MyBA user ID and password, you can create one at <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not registered with MyBA, send your adjustment request, in writing, to your tax centre.</p>
