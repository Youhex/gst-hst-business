    <!--<h2>What's changed</h2>
    <p>
      <mark>(is this still new? Is the first one specific to IFT or is more general?)</mark>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Under the new GST/HST measures for supplies of cross-border digital products and services, as well as platform-based short-term accommodation, non-resident suppliers, including digital platform operators, may be required to register under a simplified GST/HST framework and collect the GST/HST in respect of those supplies. If you are purchasing products or services from suppliers registered under the simplified GST/HST framework, and you are registered under the normal GST/HST rules, you must provide proof of registration to these suppliers to ensure they do not charge GST/HST on such supplies. Failing to provide this information may result in difficulties in recovering the GST/HST you paid on those supplies since the GST/HST paid cannot be claimed as an input tax credit or a rebate. For more detailed information on recovering the GST/HST paid on supplies acquired from suppliers registered under the simplified registration regime, please consult <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/notice322/recovery-gst-hst-under-digital-economy-measures.html">GST/HST Notice 322</a>.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Third party software is required</h2>
    <p>You will need to have accounting software that supports the GST/HST Internet File Transfer. Consult our list of <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-ift-software.html#crtfd">certified software vendors</a>. If you do not wish to use accounting software, you can still file your return electronically using <a href="cmpr_mthds">other filing methods that suit your needs</a>.</p> -->
    <h2 id="lgblty">Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Filing using Internet File Transfer is available to most GST/HST registrants, <strong>excluding</strong> those with accounts that are administered by Revenu Québec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
    <p>The following registrants are <strong>not eligible</strong> to use GST/HST Internet File Transfer and must use an alternate filing method:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants whose accounts are administered by Revenu Québec</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Builders required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return)
        <ul>
          <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants required to recapture input tax credits for the provincial portion of the HST on specified property or services (Schedules B and C of the GST/HST return)
        <ul>
          <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE or file through a participating financial institution that offers electronic filing for GST/HST returns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Before you start</h2>
    <p>Before using GST/HST Internet File transfer, ensure you meet the following requirements:</p>

      <li>You are using a browser which supports TLS 1.2
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using an older browser that does not support the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/canadasite/en/revenue-agency/corporate/access-online-services-safely.html#h4">latest security standard</a>, you will not be able to access CRA's secure online services</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You have enabled cookies and JavaScript in your browser</li>
      <li>You have your four-digit <a href="https://test.canada.ca/cra-arc/cops/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto1_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes.html">access code</a></li>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Using <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-ift-software_proto1.html">CRA-approved third party software</a>, you generate and save an electronic version of your GST/HST return. You then access the service through the CRA application page and attach your (.tax) file.</p>
    <p>The application does a preliminary check of your return. If the return meets the basic requirements, you'll receive your confirmation number. <strong>This means that your tax return has been accepted for processing.</strong> Keep this confirmation number for your records.</p>
    <p>If there are any problems with the electronic tax return you tried to send us, we'll send you an explanation of errors or corrections needed. <strong>This means your tax return was not accepted for processing</strong>. You should save, print, or make note of all messages we send. Before trying to retransmit the return, you must make the appropriate corrections within your software according to the error messages you received and re-save your file.</p>
