    <p>GST/HST registrants are able to electronically file their returns and pay any amounts owing at the same time through participating Canadian financial institutions. The return is transmitted from the bank to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) through a system called GST/HST Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use this method to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>File the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em></li>
      <li>Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits</li>
      <li>Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits</li>
      <li>Pay the net tax you owe</li>
    </ul>
    <p><mark>Previous intro: </mark>EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use EDI to file the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>, Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits, and Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits. You can also pay the net tax you owe electronically through a participating Canadian financial institution.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You need to register with a participating financial institution</li>
      <li>You can then provide the necessary GST/HST return and payment information to them through your computer, by phone, or any other mutually agreeable method</li>
      <li>The financial institution converts the information into an electronic GST/HST return and/or payment that meets the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)'s specifications and transmits the return and/or payment to the CRA</li>
      <li>Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of using EDI</h2>
    <p>There are advantages to filing your return using EDI whether you are receiving a refund or making a payment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - you key in the information, eliminating transcription errors from further handling</li>
      <li><strong>Cash flow control</strong> - transfer of funds is guaranteed on the value date you establish with your financial institution</li>
      <li><strong>Quicker refund payments</strong> - your GST/HST refund can be <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">deposited directly</a> into your account within 10-15 calendar days</li>
      <li><strong>Convenience</strong> - EDI ends the need to mail a return</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>GST/HST EDI is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada, excluding those that are administered by Revenu Qu√©bec. If you are a selected listed financial institution (SLFI) that reports both the GST/HST and QST, please visit <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/charge-collect-which-rate/financial-institutions.html#rqfl">Determine which returns to complete and when to file</a>.</p>
    <h3>Builders - transitional information </h3>
    <p>If you are a builder required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return), you must file your return using <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile.html">GST/HST NETFILE</a>.</p>
    <h2>Recaptured input tax credits</h2>
    <p>GST/HST EDI can be used to file returns with Schedule B (recapture of input tax credits) and Schedule C (reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits). Contact your financial institution to see if they offer these filing options.</p>
    <h2>Non-residents filing GST/HST returns</h2>
    <p>Non-residents can file their GST/HST returns using EDI. However, they must complete all GST/HST amounts in Canadian dollars and remit Canadian funds to the CRA using a participating financial institution in Canada.</p>
