    <p>GST/HST registrants can electronically file their returns and pay any amounts owing at the same time through a participating Canadian financial institution. The institution transmits the return in a standard format to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) through a system called GST/HST Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>
    <p>Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service.</p>
    <p>You can use EDI to file the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Form GST34, Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</li>
      <li>Schedule&nbsp;B, for the recapture of input tax credits</li>
      <li>Schedule&nbsp;C, for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits</li>
    </ul>
    <!--    <p>
      <mark>Previous intro:</mark>
      EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format.
