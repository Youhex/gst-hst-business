    <p>GST/HST registrants can electronically file their returns and pay any amounts owing at the same time through a participating Canadian financial institution. The institution transmits the return in a standart format to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) through a system called GST/HST Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). You can use EDI to file the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Form GST34, Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</li>
      <li>Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits</li>
      <li>Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <mark>Previous intro: </mark>
      EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use EDI to file the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>, Schedule B for the recapture of input tax credits, and Schedule C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits. You can also pay the net tax you owe electronically through a participating Canadian financial institution.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You need to register with a participating financial institution</li>
      <li>You can then provide the necessary GST/HST return and payment information to them through your computer, by phone, or any other mutually agreeable method</li>
      <li>The financial institution converts the information into an electronic GST/HST return and/or payment that meets the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)'s specifications and transmits the return and/or payment to the CRA</li>
      <li>Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="lgblty">Who can file using EDI</h2>
