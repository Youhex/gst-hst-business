<h2>Using the service</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
  <li>To use GST/HST TELEFILE to file your return, dial the toll-free telephone number <strong>1-800-959-2038</strong>. An automated system will guide you through the process. The system will ask you to enter your tax information using your telephone keypad.
    <ul>
      <li>Enter all the digits of your Business Number, but do not enter the letters &quot;RT&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the following keys on your touch-tone phone to make selections during the filing process:
    <ul>
      <li>Press &quot;*&quot; to have a message repeated.</li>
      <li>Press &quot;1&quot; to answer yes or &quot;0&quot; to answer no.</li>
      <li>Press &quot;#&quot; when you have finished entering an amount.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The GST/HST TELEFILE system repeats each entry to help you file an accurate return. Make any necessary corrections before you confirm your amounts.</li>
  <li>Once the data has been entered, you will be asked to confirm that the information you entered is correct. If you answer yes, the <strong>CRA will consider your return received</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>If you hang up at any time before confirming that you want to file your return, the information you entered will not be saved. You can hang up and call again up to a maximum of six times.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The automated system will immediately issue you a six-digit confirmation number. Write down your confirmation number and <a href="#rtn_dcmnts">keep it with your records</a>. Your return will then begin processing.</li>
  <li>Consider setting up <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">direct deposit</a> to speed up any refund you may be expecting.</li>
