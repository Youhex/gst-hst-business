    <h2 id="lgblty">Eligibility</h2>
    <p>GST/HST TELEFILE is available to GST/HST registrants across Canada and the United States, <strong>excluding</strong> those with accounts administered by Revenu Québec.</p>
    <p>The following registrants are <strong>not eligible</strong> to use GST/HST TELEFILE and must use an alternate filing method:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants whose accounts are administered by Revenu Québec</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Builders required to report transitional information on housing (Schedule A of the GST/HST return)
        <ul>
          <li>These filers must use GST/HST NETFILE.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Registrants required to recapture input tax credits for the provincial portion of the HST on specified property or services (Schedules B and C of the GST/HST return)
        <ul>

      <li>The GST/HST TELEFILE system repeats each entry to help you file an accurate return. Make any necessary corrections before you confirm your amounts.</li>
      <li>Once the data has been entered, you will be asked to confirm that the information you entered is correct. If you answer yes, the <strong>CRA will consider your return received</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>If you hang up at any time before confirming that you want to file your return, the information you entered will not be saved. You can hang up and call again up to a maximum of six times.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The automated system will immediately issue you a six-digit confirmation number. Write down your confirmation number and <a href="#rtn_dcmnts">keep it with your records</a>. Your return will then begin processing.</li>
