<p>The CRA offers multiple ways of filing GST/HST returns. Due to the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) recent <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto_file-return-business_subway/mandatory-electronic-filing_proto1.html">mandatory electronic filing</a> requirement, you must understand which methods qualify for electronic filing.</p>
<h2>Joint filers</h2>
<p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rtn_dcmnts">Retaining supporting documents</h2>
<p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
<p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
