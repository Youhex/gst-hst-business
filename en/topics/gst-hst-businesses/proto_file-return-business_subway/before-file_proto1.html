      that applies to you, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/pay-when.html">When to pay</a>.</p>
    <p>You <strong>have to file</strong> a GST/HST return even if you :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have no business transactions</li>
      <li>Have no net tax to remit</li>
      <li>Are <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/account-close.html">closing a GST/HST account</a> (you need to file a final return)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can charge <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-penalties-interest.html">penalties and interest</a> on any returns or amounts we have not received by the
      <mark>due date</mark>
      .</p>
    <p>When a

      falls on a <strong>Saturday</strong>, a <strong>Sunday</strong>, or a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/public-holidays.html">public holiday recognized by the CRA</a>, your payment is on time if we receive it on the <strong>next business day</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you are elligible to file paper returns, the personalized GST/HST return (Form GST34-2) you receive will show the

    <h2>Filing rebates with your return</h2>
    <p>
      <mark>Add step in each method for this?</mark>
    </p>
    <p>If you need to file a GST/HST rebate with your return and you are unable to do it electronically, you must still file your GST/HST return electronically <strong>and</strong> mail the rebate application to the address on the rebate form no later than the day you file your electronic return.</p>
    <p>If you are using NETFILE, you must mail the rebate application form(s) only if you are including a rebate amount on your return <strong>and</strong> you did not file the corresponding rebate form electronically. </p>
    <p>To learn more about filing a GST/HST rebate application go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/gst-hst-rebates.html">Claim a GST/HST rebate</a>.</p>
    <h2>Joint filers</h2>
    <p>If you are the coordinator of a closely related group of corporations (i.e. you have filed election GST303) and you file returns electronically, you must still send your letter of direction to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a>.</p>
    <h2>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts</h2>
    <p>First Nations Tax (FNT) accounts can use GST/HST <strong>NETFILE</strong>, GST/HST <strong>TELEFILE</strong> and GST/HST <strong>Internet File Transfer</strong>. However, after filing your return, you must mail <span class="nowrap">Form GST 499-1</span> (the corresponding FNT schedule) to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-centres.html#summ">Atlantic Tax Centre</a>.</p>

      <mark>Confirm: can't they be filed using EDI? also rewrite - starting with account can use... and then your return.</mark>
    </p>
    <h2>Authorized accountants <small>(also mentioned in access code page, one should refer to the other)</small></h2>
    <p>If your accountant is legally authorized to sign the paper copy of your GST/HST return, they can use <strong>NETFILE</strong>, <strong>Internet File Transfer</strong> and <strong>TELEFILE</strong> to file your return on your behalf. They will need to use <strong>your</strong> GST/HST <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto_file-return-business_subway/choose-your-filing-method/gst-hst-access-codes_proto1.html">access code</a>.</p>
    <p>If your accountant is not authorized to file GST/HST returns on your behalf, you can sign up for <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> and add your accountant as an authorized representative.</p>
    <h2 id="rtn_dcmnts">Retaining supporting documents</h2>
    <p>You do not have to send receipts or supporting documents when you file your GST/HST information electronically. However, keep all supporting documents for six years, as the CRA may contact you for more information after they process your return.</p>
    <p>You should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
