<!--<h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Using <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/how-file/how-file-third-party-software/software-gst-hst-ift.html">certified CRA-approved GST/HST software</a>, you generate and save an electronic version of your GST/HST return. You then access the service through the CRA application page and attach your (.tax) file.</p>
    <p>The application does a preliminary check of your return. If the return meets the basic requirements, you'll receive your confirmation number. <strong>This means that your tax return has been accepted for processing.</strong> Keep this confirmation number for your records.</p>
    <p>If there are any problems with the electronic tax return you tried to send us, we'll send you an explanation of errors or corrections needed. <strong>This means your tax return was not accepted for processing</strong>. You should save, print, or make note of all messages we send. Before trying to retransmit the return, you must make the appropriate corrections within your software according to the error messages you received and re-save your file.</p>-->
