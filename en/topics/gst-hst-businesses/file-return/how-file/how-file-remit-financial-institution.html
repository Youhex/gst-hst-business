<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">How to file and remit though a financial institution<span class="wb-inv"> – File your GST/HST return</span></h1>
<p>GST/HST registrants can electronically file their returns and pay any amounts owing at the same time through a participating Canadian financial institution. The institution transmits the return in a standard format to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) through a system called GST/HST Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>
<p>Some financial institutions may charge a fee for this service.</p>
<!--    <p>
      <mark>Previous intro:</mark>
      EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of information in a standard format. You can use EDI to file the electronic equivalent of Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>, Schedule&nbsp;B for the recapture of input tax credits, and Schedule&nbsp;C for the reconciliation of recaptured input tax credits. You can also pay the net tax you owe electronically through a participating Canadian financial institution.</p>-->
