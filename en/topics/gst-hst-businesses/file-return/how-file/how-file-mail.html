<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">How to file by mail<span class="wb-inv"> â€“ File your GST/HST return</span></h1>

    <p>To file a paper return, you can either mail your GST/HST return (GST34-2) to the address on your return, or file in person at a participating financial institution. Only charities and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#qstslfi">selected listed financial institutions</a> are not required to file online.</p>
    <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> file in person at a participating financial institution if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are claiming a refund</li>
      <li>You are filing a nil return</li>
      <li>You offset the amount owing on your return with a rebate or refund</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Your personalized GST/HST return package</h2>
    <p>Each fiscal year, the CRA will mail you a personalized <span class="nowrap">GST34-3</span> return package that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an information sheet with your reporting periods and due dates</li>
      <li>an access code for filing your returns electronically on GST/HST NETFILE or by phone using GST/HST TELEFILE</li>
      <li>remittance vouchers to use if you make your payments at your financial institution</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If you are filing electronically</strong> and make two consecutive electronic payments, the CRA will no longer send you a filing package unless you request one.</p>
    <p><strong>If you file on paper</strong>, the CRA will send you the <span class="nowrap">GST34-2</span> filing information package, which also includes personalized returns. You can use the access code provided in the package if you decided to start using GST/HST NETFILE or GST/HST TELEFILE.</p>
    <p><strong>If you need a new return package or access code</strong>, do <strong>one </strong>of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to request a new <span class="nowrap">GST34-2</span> or <span class="nowrap">GST34-3</span>, call <strong><span class="nowrap">1-800-959-5525</span></strong></li>
      <li>to get a new access code for GST/HST NETFILE or GST/HST TELEFILE, go to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/digital-services-businesses/gst-hst-netfile/need-access-code.html">GST/HST Access Code Online</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also register for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> to view the due dates for your returns, make electronic payments or file your GST/HST returns without an access code.</p>
