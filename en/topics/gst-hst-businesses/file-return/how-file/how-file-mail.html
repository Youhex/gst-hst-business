<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">How to file by mail<span class="wb-inv"> â€“ File your GST/HST return</span></h1>

 <p>To file a paper return, you can either mail your GST/HST return to the address on your return, or file in person at a participating financial institution. 
        
      <p>Only charities and selected listed financial institutions can file by mail without a penalty. Refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/how-file.html#h_1">Mandatory electronic filing</a>.</p>

    <h2>Get a GST/HST return form</h2>
<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need a return form if you are filing electronically. If you file electronically and make two consecutive electronic payments, we will not send you a filing package unless you request one. However, to help you calculate and complete your taxes, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/bspsbch/rtrns/wrkngcp-eng.pdf">download a working copy of the GST/HST return</a>. Do not mail us your working copy.</p>

<h3>Request a new GST/HST return form</h3>
    <p>To request a new GST/HST return form (<span class="nowrap">GST34-2</span> or <span class="nowrap">GST34-3</span>), <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/contact-us.html">contact us by phone</a>.</p>
<p>If you normally file on paper, the CRA will automatically mail you a personalized <span class="nowrap">GST34-3</span> return package that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An information sheet with your reporting periods and due dates</li>
      <li>An access code for filing your returns electronically outside of your CRA account</li>
      <li>Remittance vouchers to use if you make your payments at your financial institution</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Where to send your return</h2>
<p>Mail your GST/HST return to the <strong>address printed on your return</strong>.</p>
<p>To mail us other documents, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">Find a CRA mailing address</a></p>

<h3>Filing in person at a financial institution</h3>
<p>Most GST/HST registrants can bring their paper return to a participating financial institution to file it.</p>
    <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> file in person at a participating financial institution if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are claiming a refund</li>
      <li>You are filing a nil return</li>
      <li>You offset the amount owing on your return with a rebate or refund</li>
    </ul>
