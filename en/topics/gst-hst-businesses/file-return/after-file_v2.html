<h2 id="h_1">What happens after you file</h2>
<p>Once we process your GST/HST return, we will send you a <strong>notice of assessment</strong>, only if one of the following statements is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are owed a refund or rebate</li>
  <li>The amount you owe is more than what you paid</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still owe money, we will also send you a <strong>remittance voucher</strong> (a payment slip) so you can <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/remit-pay-gst-hst-collected.html">pay your balance</a>
  <mark>(note section on this page re paying)</mark>
  .</p>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Notice of assessment</h3>
<p>If we send you a notice of assessment <strong>and</strong> you are signed up for email notifications, we will email you to let you know there is mail in your online <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>. If you are not signed up, we will mail you a paper copy.</p>
<p>Your notice of assessment may include details about penalties and interest if you owe money. To learn more, visit <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-penalties-interest.html">GST/HST – Penalties and interest</a></p>
<h3 id="h_1_2">When to expect your refund</h3>
<p>You can claim a refund if your <strong>net tax</strong> (line 109 of your GST/HST return) is a negative amount.</p>
<p>In most cases, we process GST/HST returns within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Your refund may be delayed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You did not include all necessary information</li>
  <li>You did not complete your return correctly</li>
</ul>
<p>If you signed up for direct deposit, we will deposit your refund directly into your bank account. To learn more, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Payments the CRA sends you</a>.</p>
<p>If you are owed interest on your refund, we will pay it based on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Interest is compounded daily on an overpayment <strong>up to and including</strong> the day the overpayment is refunded or applied to another debt.</p>
<h4>Refund holds</h4>
<p>If you have any missing returns or unpaid amounts under other acts administered by the CRA, we can hold your GST/HST refund or rebate until you have filed your required returns and paid your outstanding amounts.</p>
<p>These acts include:</p>
<ul class="colcount-sm-2">
  <li>Excise Tax Act</li>
  <li>Excise Act 2001</li>
  <li>Income Tax Act</li>
  <li>Air Travellers Security Charge Act</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor or part of a partnership, we will also hold your personal income tax refund.</p>
<p>We can also use any GST/HST refund or rebate that you are entitled to receive to pay your outstanding amount.</p>
<h2 id="h_2">Paying your balance</h2>
<p>If you owe money, we will also send you a personalized remittance slip that you can use to pay your balance: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html#rc159">Form RC159, Remittance Voucher – Amount Owing</a>.</p>
<p>Form RC159 is <strong>not available </strong>electronically. You can order a personalized printed copy by  signing in to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA online account</a> and accessing
  <mark>your business or your representive services</mark>
  .</p>
<h2 id="h_3">Checking a previous return</h2>
<p>To view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return, sign in to your online <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a> to access My Business Account or Represent a client.</p>
<p>You can also view upcoming or overdue GST/HST returns by using the same digital services.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">Fixing mistakes on a return</h2>
<h3 id="h_4_1">Changing a return you already file</h3>
<p>If you made a mistake on a GST/HST return you already filed, <strong>do not file a new return</strong>. Instead you must submit an adjustment to your filed return in one of the folowing ways:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">

      <li>Make the necessary changes to your return</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Mail us adjustment information<span class="wb-inv">: Option 2</span></h4>
    <p>Send a <strong>letter</strong> to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a> with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your GST/HST <strong>business number</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>reporting period</strong> you need to correct</li>
      <li>The <strong>corrected amounts</strong> for each line on your return</li>
      <li>The <strong>name and phone number</strong> of someone we can contact if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The letter must be signed by the <strong>business owner</strong> or an <strong>authorized representative</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_4_2">Make a voluntary disclosure</h3>
<p>The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Correct incorrect or missing information</li>
  <li>Report information you did not include in a previous return</li>
</ul>
<p>You may apply to the VDP to be granted relief on applicable penalties and prosecution. If you qualify, you will only have to pay the tax owed and any interest.</p>

<h2 id="h_5">Prepare for reviews and audits</h2>
<h3 id="h_5_1">What you need to keep</h3>
<p>When you file electronically, you should keep a copy of your return and any other information you used to prepare it. These records are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
<p>To learn more about what other documents you need to keep, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/calculate-prepare-report/gst-hst-records-keep.html">GST/HST records to keep</a></p>
<h3 id="h_5_2">How to prepare for a post-assessment review</h3>
<p>We may contact you for a <strong>post-assessment review</strong> to verify the amounts on your return. This is <strong>not</strong> an audit.</p>
<p>During this review, we may ask you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the amounts reported on your return</li>
  <li>Provide supporting documents like receipts or invoices</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, we will make adjustments to your return.</p>

<h3 id="h_5_3">How to prepare for an audit</h3>
<p>A tax audit can be overwhelming. Asking yourself the following questions may help you prepare for an audit :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do we audit and what is a tax audit?</li>
  <li>What are your responsibilities and what happens during an audit?</li>
  <li>What are your rights?</li>
</ul>
