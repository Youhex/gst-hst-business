<h2 id="h_1">What happens after you file</h2>
<p>Once we process your GST/HST return, we will send you a <a href="#h_1_1">notice of assessment</a>, only if one of the following statements is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are owed a refund or rebate</li>
  <li>The amount you owe is more than what you paid</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still owe money, we will also send you a <strong>remittance voucher</strong> (a payment slip) so you can <a href="#h_2">pay your balance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Notice of assessment</h3>
<p>If we send you a notice of assessment <strong>and</strong> you are signed up for email notifications, we will email you to let you know there is mail in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>. If you are not signed up, we will mail you a paper copy.Your notice of assessment may include details about penalties and interest if you owe money.

<h3 id="h_1_2">When you will get your refund</h3>
<p>You can claim a refund if your <strong>net tax</strong> (line 109 of your GST/HST return) is a negative amount.</p>
<p>In most cases, we process GST/HST returns within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Your refund may be delayed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You didn't include all necessary information</li>
  <li>You have outstanding amounts or missing tax returns from other programs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you owe money under other programs administered by the CRA, we may hold your GST/HST refund or rebate to and use them pay off your debt instead of sending it to you.</p>
<p>If you signed up for direct deposit, we will deposit your refund directly into your bank account. To learn more, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Payments the CRA sends you - Canada.ca</a>.</p>
<p>If you are owed interest on your refund, we will pay it based on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Interest is compounded daily on an overpayment <strong>up to and including</strong> the day the overpayment is refunded or applied to another debt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explain the amounts reported on your return</li>
