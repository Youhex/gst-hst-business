    <h2 id="toc0">When your final balance is due</h2>
    <p>Your payment deadline depends on your GST/HST filing period. Most GST/HST payments are due at the same time as your GST/HST returns. Your payment deadline is <strong>different</strong> than your filing deadline if you are <strong>an annual filer who either</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Has a December 31 fiscal year-end and business income for tax purposes</li>
        <li>Has to remit (pay) the GST/HST by instalments</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must remit (pay) the GST/HST for any invoice you include in your return, even if you have not yet been paid.</p>

<p>To see the due dates for different reporting periods, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/proto_file-return-business_subway/before-file_proto2.html#toc2">Filing and payment deadlines</p>
    
    <h2 id="toc1">Paying by instalments</h2>
    <p>If you have an <strong>annual reporting period</strong>, you may need to pay your GST/HST in instalments throughout the year.</p>
    <p>To find out who must pay in instalments and how to calculate them, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/exit-intent.html?uri=https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/pay-instalment.html">Remit (pay) the GST/HST by instalments</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">How to make a payment</h2>
    <p>There are three ways to make a payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronically</li>
<li>At your financial institution in Canada</li>
<li>By mail</li>
</ul>
    <p>To see the options of how to pay, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/individual-payments/make-payment.html">Make a payment to the CRA</p>
<p>Payments of <strong>$10,000 or more </strong>must be paid electronically or at your financial institution. You can make your payments in foreign funds. In this case, the financial institution handling your transaction determines the exchange rate for converting the payment to Canadian dollars.</p>

<h3>Remittance vouchers</h3>

<p>You do not need a remittance voucher to pay online.</p>

<p>If you file your GST/HST return electronically, you can still remit your GST/HST at your financial institution. Use Form RC158, Remittance Voucher – Payment on Filing. Do not use the remittance part of your GST/HST return.</p>
<p>Other remittance forms for GST/HST payments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form RC159, Remittance Voucher – Amount Owing, to remit an amount owing or an outstanding balance for a period&nbsp;that has already been assessed</li>
<li>Form RC160, Remittance Voucher – Interim Payments, to remit your instalment payments</li>
<li>Form RC177, Remittance Voucher – Balance Due, to remit an amount owing before you file your return</li>
</ul>
<p>These remittance forms are not available to download from the CRA web site because they are personalized to your payment. They are only available in a pre-printed format through your CRA account or by contacting us by phone. For more information on how to get the remittance voucher you need, refer to: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html">Order remittance vouchers or payment forms</a>.</p>
  

    
        <h2 id="toc3">What to do if you cannot pay</h2>
<p>If you cannot pay your balance owing, you can make a payment arrangement. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra/payment-arrangements.html">Arrange to pay your debt over time</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="toc4">How and when interest applies to late payments</h2>
<p></p>

            <h2 id="toc5">Confirm, view or change a payment</h2>
    <p>Business owners (including partners, directors, and officers) can access their GST/HST, payroll, corporation income taxes, excise taxes, excise duties and other levies accounts online.</p>
<p>In your CRA account, you can:
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm a balance owing</li>
         <li>View an interim balance of payments and credits</li>
         <li>Transfer certain payments you made </li>
         <li>Select a period end, balance, or total amount to view the corresponding transactions</li>
         <li>Transfer certain payments you made from one account to another</li>
